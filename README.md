# ESP32-S3-Box-3 LVGL Firmware 
ESP Home Configuration for the S3-Box-3 with an LVGL UI.

All credit and inspiration for the original UI and device configuration goes to https://github.com/BigBobbas/ESP32-S3-Box3-Custom-ESPHome/

This firmware provides the S3 box 3 with a voice assistant, timers, screen saver with analog/digital clock and sleep, 12/24 hour time, media controls, radar/presence sensing, temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit) and humidity sensing, battery levels and indicator, alarmo integration, alarm clock, internal and external audio, notifications with sound, and multiple pages for lights, thermostats, switches, media, scenes, locks other devices from your Home Assistant.

A UI Mode feature provides the ability to switch the user experience with 3 modes: Default, HAL, Home.
Each provides a different theme and voice assistant interface.
- Default provides the original theme and a more standard Home Assistant experience. 
- HAL provides a darker theme and an animated Space Odyssey inspired 2001 HAL voice assistant.
- Home provides a more subtle theme and an animated Google inspired voice assistant.
The wakeword is not tied to the UI Mode providing flexibility for your preferred experience.

The On Device Wake Word includes the standard ESPHome wakeword models (4) but also some experimental models including okay hal and hey luna.
Additional experimental wake words for okay computer and hey home assistant and included in the config but disabled by default. 

The UI and Voice Assistant experience is implemented out of the box.
Configuration is required to integrate button actions into your Home Assistant.
This configuration is suitable for anyone with an understanding of ESPHOME, the S3-Box-3, Home Assistant and Wake Word Voice Assistants.

# Configuration Guidance
To use the wake, notify and timer sounds with external audio you will need to load the sounds folder to the www folder in your home assistant. This can be done through an add on like Filebrowser or SambaShare.

LVGL functions differently to the standard ESPHOME UI. Instead of using lambda to construct pages and format them separate to the touch screen configuration, LVGL uses a hierarchical page structure combining the touchscreen and UI elements.
This means the LVGL section of the YAML contains all the UI elements including the pages and widgets. These widgets are interactive and have different actions associated to their type. 
Setting the status of these widgets is not done in the LVGL configuration. Instead each component forces appropriate updates to the UI. So when a switch is turned on or off it needs to update the lvgl switch widget to be checked or not checked.
This means the UI updates interactively so that as actions are performed which send service calls to home assistant or trigger local actions, the corresponding state changes in sensors can update the UI in response.
For each new or modified widget you need to update the LVGL to specify the action to take when a UI interaction occurs and in parallel you need to update the entity to update the UI on state changes.

Example entity configuration is included to match the screens above providing starting configuration for how different types of devices can be configured.
